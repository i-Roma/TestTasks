# Vapp iOS Developer Challenge.

## Introduction.
Hi! thank you for your time participating in this challenge.
With this challenge, we want to know your programming skills and experience, when evaluating, we will focus on code organization and readability. 
We don't want to steal a lot of time from candidates, so if you have time to spare doing the test, review the clarity of your code, do not implement not mentioned extras, they will not add points.
Once the challenge project is finished, you can send it to us compressed in a zip or upload it to a Github-type repository, but if you upload it, please do not include words like Voicemod in the project or the description. 

## Prerequisites.
* The challenge must be implemented in Swift and the app should be compatible with iOS 14.
* Focus on code organization and readability, organize your code thinking that is going to grow in a future small-medium app maintained by two or three developers.
* Use of third-party libraries is allowed, not mandatory.
* The application should be usable, but aesthetics are not important.

## Challenge description and goals.
Using the simple test API https://reqres.in we want that you implement an app with two lists of users. One list with the first page of users returned by the API, and another list with the ones marked as favorite by the user. Achieve this goal is mandatory:
* Load the first page of users returned by  https://reqres.in/api/users in a list.
* The cell of the user should display first name, last name, and avatar.
* Add a favorite button on the cell, with selected and unselected states.
* When marked as favorite the user should appear in the favorite user's list.
* Write some unit test, is not necessary to have all the app fully tested.

## Bonus.
* Write the app using SwiftUI.
* Write the app using some reactive programming technology.
